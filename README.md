### CO-OP
Regrettably I started the process to late and was not able to finish all of the steps before the due date.  I must have missed the part in the Project details where it said that the Co-op process needed to be started as soon as possible.  

What I did do was fill out my (Co-op Student Application of Interest) form, but I am still waiting for a career center staff member to contact me.  
(I have uploaded a screen shot of my submitted application.)

I also re-wrote my Resume, gearing it towards an Internship or a Co-op opportunity in the IT field and uploaded it at College Central Network.

Going through the process to become Co-op ready has been one of the most important things that we have done this semester, and I am kicking myself that I did not do the reading first to receieve full credit.  I will definitely be completing the full assignment even after all the grades are submitted because Co-oping has always been something I've been interested in.
