### CO-OP
 

What I did do was fill out my (Co-op Student Application of Interest) form, but I am still waiting for a career center staff member to contact me.  
(I have uploaded a screen shot of my submitted application.)

I also re-wrote my Resume, gearing it towards an Internship or a Co-op opportunity in the IT field and uploaded it at College Central Network.

Going through the process to become Co-op ready has been one of the most important things that we have done this semester, and I am kicking myself that I did not do the reading first to receieve full credit.  I will definitely be completing the full assignment even after all the grades are submitted because Co-oping has always been something I've been interested in.  Completing the Co-op ready checklist ulitimately opens up the next door in both my education and my career, which is a perfect way for this course to leave off.

Overall, I thought this course was a bit tedious at times with the same structure every week (I know some of that had to do with the class being online), and some of the labs were extremely time-consuming, and hard to follow.  BUT, I have to say the course did cover a good wide veriety of IT areas.  This class really is the perfect starting point to get students acclaimated to Information Tech as a whole so they can decide for themselves if it is for them or not.  I would definitely recommend this class to other young IT students.
