### CO-OP
Regrettably I started the process to late and was not able to finish all of the steps before the due date.  I must have missed the part in the Project details where it said that the Co-op process needed to be started as soon as possible.  

What I did do was fill out my (Co-op Student Application of Interest) form, but I am still waiting for a career center staff member to contact me.  
(I have uploaded a screen shot of my submitted application.)
